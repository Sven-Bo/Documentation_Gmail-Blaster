# How many emails can I send per day with Gmail Blaster?

For free Gmail accounts, Google allows you to send up to **500 emails per day**. If you need a higher limit, consider upgrading to a **Google Workspace account**, which offers enhanced capabilities.

**Important:** Gmail imposes these limits to prevent spam and protect accounts. Exceeding these limits may result in errors like:

* "You have reached a limit for sending mail."
* "Messages you sent couldn't be delivered."
