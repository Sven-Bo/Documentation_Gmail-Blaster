If youâ€™re seeing this error:

```
The message could not be sent to the SMTP server. The transport error code was 0x80040217. The server response was not available.
```

This usually means that your **email address or app password is incorrect**.

#### How to Fix It

1. **Double-check your email address**\
   Make sure there are no typos.
2. **Make sure youâ€™re using an app password**\
   You canâ€™t use your normal Gmail login. You need to create an app-specific password.

3. **Paste the app password exactly**\
   Itâ€™s a 16-character code â€” make sure it has no extra spaces.
