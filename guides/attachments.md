# Attachments

You have the option to include attachments with your emails. Here’s how to manage them:

* **No Attachments:**\
  If you don’t need to send any attachments, simply leave the attachment field empty. No files will be sent.
*   **Single Attachment:**\
    To send a single attachment, insert the full file path into the attachment field. \
    Example:

    ```makefile
    C:\Users\YourName\Documents\example.txt
    ```
*   **Multiple Attachments:**\
    If you need to send multiple attachments, separate each file path with a semicolon `;`. \
    Example:

    ```mathematica
    C:\Users\YourName\Documents\example1.txt;C:\Users\YourName\Documents\example2.txt
    ```
* **Select & Copy Attachments Button:**\
  To simplify selecting attachments, you can use the **Select & Copy Attachments** button. This allows you to browse and select files. After confirming your selection, the file paths will be automatically copied to your clipboard. You can then paste them into the attachment field.
