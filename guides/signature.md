# Signature

There are two ways to include a signature in your emails using Gmail Blaster.

#### 1. Simple Signature in the Email Body

You can directly include a simple signature in the email body just by typing it out. This can be plain text or basic formatting (bold, italic, etc.).

**Example:**

```
Best regards,  
Sven from PythonAndVBA.com
```

#### 2. HTML Signature in the Settings

If you already have an HTML signature, you can input it into the **SETTINGS** sheet. This signature will automatically be appended to the bottom of the email body.

**Example:**\
You can generate a free HTML signature using websites like [Mail Signatures](https://www.mail-signatures.com/signature-generator/). Once you have your HTML signature, paste it into the **SIGNATURE** field in the settings.

Gmail Blaster will then include this HTML signature at the end of every email you send.
