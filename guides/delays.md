# Delays

You can configure the delay between sending each email in the **SETTINGS** sheet. This is important to ensure Gmail Blaster runs smoothly, and it gives Gmail some time to process each email before moving on to the next.

#### Recommended Delay

I recommend setting a minimum delay of **1 second** to give the Gmail Blaster enough time to "breathe" between messages. If you're sending large volumes of emails or adding attachments, you may want to increase this delay slightly to ensure smoother operation.
