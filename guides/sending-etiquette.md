# Sending Etiquette

You know that feeling when you’ve written a solid message, hit send, and… silence? No replies. No opens. Nothing.

Chances are, the email never made it to the inbox — or it got ignored because it felt like spam.

The fix? A bit of sending etiquette. Here’s how to stay on Gmail’s good side (and your recipients’, too).

***

### Email People Who Know You

Gmail Blaster is made for things like:

* Notifying your clients about new pricing
* Sending updates to your newsletter list
* Following up with people who actually signed up to hear from you

It’s not made for cold outreach or scraping emails off LinkedIn. Gmail doesn’t like that, and neither do recipients.

**In short:** if they didn’t expect the message, don’t send it.

### Skip the Spammy Stuff

Spam filters are smarter than ever. And they’re quick to block emails that sound pushy, fake, or too good to be true.

Phrases like:

* “100% free”
* “Act now!”
* “Get rich fast”

...can tank your delivery.

👉 If you want to be safe, check your message here before sending:\

It flags risky words and gives you a quick spam score.

### Keep It Personal

Even if you're sending 300 emails, each one should feel like it was written for one person.

You can use **placeholders** like `{{name}}` to insert the recipient’s name, and even use **spintext** like `[[Hi|Hello|Hey]]` to vary your greetings. That little touch helps make bulk messages feel more human — and less like a mass blast.

If it feels like something you'd write to a colleague, you're on the right track.

### Don’t Overdo It With Links

Too many links = bad news. Especially shortened ones (like bit.ly), which Gmail often flags.

Stick to 1–2 clean, full links. No need to overlink every sentence.

***

### Don’t Hit the Limit

Just a reminder:

* Free Gmail accounts can send up to **500 emails per day**
* Google Workspace accounts can send up to **2,000 per day**

Hit those too fast, and Gmail might pause your account.

So take it slow. Spread things out when needed.

### Final Thought

This tool makes sending easier. But smart sending makes sure your emails actually land — and get read.

Write like a person. Respect the inbox. Avoid spammy language.\
That’s really all it takes.
